This project is a Hybrid Test Automation Framework built using Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Maven, following the Page Object Model (POM) design.
The framework supports cross-browser testing (Chrome, Edge, Firefox), parallel execution, and GitHub Actions CI/CD.
Test data is stored externally (testdata.JSON), and execution is config-driven (local/remote, headless mode).
Detailed Allure HTML reports with screenshots are generated for better traceability and debugging.
